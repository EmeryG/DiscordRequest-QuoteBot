# DiscordRequest-QuoteBot
The bot is centralized around 5 ids that are hard coded. They are listed at the top of the file. 
Basically upon the user messaging the bot or entering the server, the bot messages the user
and asks for a confirmation. Then the user gives the confirmation and tells the bot the description
of the product it would like. Then the description and order number goes into the quoting chat,
where servicers can compete for quotes (the quotes are deleted as sent to give less biased numbers).
Then the user can accept the quote by reacting with the :white_check_mark: to the bot's message, which
then adds the user, the CEO group, the bot, and the servicer into a new channel on the server.
The user can then start a new with a new quote if they choose.
